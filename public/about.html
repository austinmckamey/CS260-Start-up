				Oh, let me tell you about the classic game of Snake! It's the only 
				game I want to play because it's so addictively fun and challenging.		
			</p>
			<p class="text secondary">
				In Snake, you control a small pixelated snake that moves around a 
				grid-like playing field. The objective is simple: eat as many dots as
				you can while avoiding running into the snake's own body.
			</p>
			<p class="text secondary">
				Each time the snake eats a dot, it grows longer, making it more 
				difficult to navigate without crashing into yourself.
			</p>
			<p class="text secondary padding-bottom">
				I love how Snake's simple yet addictive gameplay can keep me entertained 
				for hours. It's a classic game that has stood the test of time, and 
				I can see myself playing it for years to come. If you haven't played 
				Snake before, I highly recommend giving it a try!
